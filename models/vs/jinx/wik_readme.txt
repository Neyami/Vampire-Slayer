EDIT: I got permission from Firestarter to use these models in Revenant (he made them) though I couldn't get a reply from the mappers. Note that there is an AHL version of Revenant, so it's not like I just ripped them from an AHL map to use for some other mod. I would prefer that you did NOT use these models in other VS maps without going after permission like I did.

-------------------------

these gargoyles were used in the 'wikked' AHL maps, which were later open-sourced. they are for use in Action HL maps ONLY. you may NOT use these gargoyles in a map for any other mod!

"Firestarter" did the models, I think.

Here is the rest of the documentation that goes with the open-sourced 'wikked' maps:
