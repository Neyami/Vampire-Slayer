# WIP
Sven Co-op version of the Half-Life mod Vampire Slayer by Routetwo

If you want to keep the VS resources out of the regular svencoop_addon or whatever files, you can put them in "Sven Co-op\svencoop_event_vampslay"  
This will require putting event_info.txt in the same folder, using the console command `ev_scan` or restarting the game, then `ev_enable vampslay`
