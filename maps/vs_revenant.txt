------About This Map-------------------------------------------------

Revenant is based on a map layout I drew up about 5 years ago- before I got a computer! I was bored one night a few months ago and took about an hour to make the basic layout in Hammer. Then I went back and started to work on it and retexture it and... it ended up being pretty damn cool!

"Revenant" is an allusion to the DOOM baddie of the same name.


------Credits and Thanks---------------------------------------------

Sobek, RamOne, and RouteTwo for their feedback and support on the VS version of this map. Couldn't have done it without you guys! :)

Orpheus, Alice, corpsinhere, and everyone else who gave me such good feedback on this map. And the AHLMD forums and Snarkpit in general. The map is better because of their help!

BORG for the rain sounds outside (from Stormvale originally).

MeanRabbit.com (http://www.meanrabbit.com) for the rain sound on the roof (mr_ prefix).

The people at Valve who did Deathmatch Classic. I use mostly textures from this mod in the map, as well as a skybox from it.

Firestarter, Rawhyde, Heatmiser... basically the "wikked" folks who open-sourced those maps for Action HL. The gargoyle models are from those packs, please see the readme in the models/jinx/ directory for more information and terms of use. (http://www.wikkedwares.com/main.htm)
