vs_torment info
--------------
Time took to create:  4 days.

Time took to compile:  about 10 mins.

Custom anything: Theme song is original and was created for the map.

Special Areas: None, what you see is what you get.

Concept: I hanvt seen very many duel maps for VS, so I decided to put one together.  The concept started out as an 'at the gates of hell' idea...but quickly became a castle with lava beneath.  It turned out fairly nice.


Other Maps: vs_frost, vs_bitten, de_lunar, de_bumrush, cs_lgn.  -All can be found at jmwrightdesigns.com
