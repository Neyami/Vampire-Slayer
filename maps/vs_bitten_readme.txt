vs_bitten info
--------------
Time took to create:  on and off for a couple months.

Time took to compile:  about 30 mins.

Custom anything: A few custom textures & sounds...see below for more.

Special Areas: None, what you see is what you get.

Concept: I went for a dirty/dark feel.  This map is a cross between a rundown city & an underground cavern. Slayers start out on the street while the Vampires are in the heart of the tomb.

Other Maps: de_lunar, de_bumrush, cs_lgn.  -All can be found at jmwrightdesigns.com
