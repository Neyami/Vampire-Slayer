vs_desolation info
--------------
Time took to create:  on and off for a couple months.

Time took to compile:  about 3 hrs, ridiculously long due to how its basically 1 big open area.  r_speeds & FPS are still good.

Custom anything: A few custom sounds...the radio broadcast taken from Night of The Living Dead. There are some clips of people screaming that I got off the internet. Also, a 10 second clip of some rock tune, I have no idea who its by.

Special Areas: None, what you see is what you get.

Concept: This map was originally designed to feature the bike in Chapter 6.  I wasnt able to test the bike in game until after most of the map was created...and I then realized I made the roads too small.  Instead of reworking the whole thing, I left it as a 'classic' style VS map.  I then went on to create vs_roadster, which was tailored specifically for the bike. 
This map, vs_desolation, is a rundown town that has been taken over by vampires.  Enjoy.

Notes: This map was created for VS Chapter 6 my JMW.  I didnt spell check this .txt, so excuse any errors.
