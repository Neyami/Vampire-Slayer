Vampires: you have settled into the old mill, protect your new home
at all costs. Go on a caroling rampage of terror!

Slayers: Give the vampires the gift of everlasting death this Christmas.



(Note all textures with a drain pipe are climb-able)

(Note almost all gates are breakable)


Also I would like to thank X-Tender for the use of his textures
