you can win rounds in three possible ways:
1) take out the whole enemy team

2) capture the enemy cross and bring it back to your base (your cross must be there in order to win the round)
 note: vampires should not leap while carrying the cross!

3) **VAMPIRES ONLY** destroy all cars on the car-park and the computers that are controlling the barriers so
 the slayers cannot escape

1)
If you want to climb up the ladder from the cellar you get stuck on the top for some reason.
However, this problem can be solved when you hold down your crouch key and then continue to climb up.
