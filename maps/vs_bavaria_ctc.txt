STORY:
	A small town, Bavaria, has had unexpected deaths
	throughout the year. One house has been under
	close watch for the past 3 months. Investigation
	started on the house by the townspeople, which
	lead to their demise. The towns people where 
	slaughtered, all but one. This one man knew only
	one thing, one team could help the city. The man
	rushed home and wrote a letter and mailed it off
	right away. Weeks later the letter was recieved
	read. Within seconds the slayer team stormed out.
	The travel took only 3 days but when they arrived 
	3 days was just too long for the people. If you fail
	we are all doomed. Let god be with you.

Slayer:
	This is what you have been waiting for, find every
	vampire and stake them. If all else fails and you
	are slaughtered rush for their nest and get the stake
	and bring it back as soon as you can.

Vampire:
	The humans have begun another invasion on our territory.
	We have taken care of the others, theres no problem taking
	care of these ones. Rush them as soon as possible and tear
	their throats out. If it is a total victory by them, get 
	their cross and retreat back to thes nest and capture it.
	Do not fail

Notes:
	Thx to the Day of Defeat mod for releasing their textures.
	Really great set of textures. Also thx to a few who have
	helped me with ideas, wait it was all me, pfft forget you
	all! Have fun and kick some ass.
