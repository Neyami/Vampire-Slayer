
VS_YAMAMANSION by Yamazaki (Brian Dorner)

Slayers: You have tracked down the vampires and followed them back
to their lair, a stately mansion in the countryside. The whole 
place has the stench of evil, it appears they've been conducting 
black magic experiments. This will be a difficult fight as you're 
on their turf now, but hopefully the element of surprise will win 
the battle.

Vampires: It seems uninvited guests have arrived at your home. 
You've put too much effort into claiming this home to flee now. 
Defend the mansion against these so-called slayers. Teach them 
a lesson that they'll carry with them to their graves.
