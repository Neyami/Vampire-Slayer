Slayers find an old vampire hangout in a hotel.  The elevator 
on the left moves between the first and second floors, the 
elevator on the right goes to the first and third floors.  
Or you could just take the stairs.

Slayers: Proceed with caution vampires can be around any corner!  
Stick with your party and watch for noisy floor boards.

Vampires: When the slayer invasion begins your vampire pals are 
scattered though out the hotel.  Unite with your cohorts and rid 
of this slayer torment.  If low on health progress to the 
"blood bath" on the second floor to regain health.
