vs_roadster info
--------------
Time took to create:  on and off for a couple months.

Time took to compile:  about 15 mins.

Custom anything: A few custom sounds...the radio broadcast taken from Night of The Living Dead. The rock tune is a clip from Korn's song called Right Now.

Special Areas: None, what you see is what you get.

Concept: I wanted to put a map out there that utilized the new bike feature in VS Chapter 6.  I created a large forest/mountain map that works well with many players and bikes.

Notes: I made all of the trees cycler_sprites so that you can walk through them.  I did this so they would not cause problems when riding the bikes.

Other Maps: Too many to list.  VS/MS/CS/DMC/Q3  -All can be found at jmwrightdesigns.com
